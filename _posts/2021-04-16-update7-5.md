Hello! I have been quite unproductive recently. I took some time and found the source and I realized for the most part, it's because I've been stuck at home for around 2 years now. I actively try new things every once in a while but sometimes it doesn't work! Do I have an exact solution right now? Well not exactly. But will find a way.

I thought this part of the project development process should be documented too. So I wrote about it.

Until I find a way, I'm gonna keep studying and reading some tutorials. So it's not gonna be the *worst* thing ever.

Anyways, you can check out the Ava sound engine repo from [here](https://github.com/funktional-stdo/ava).
