The content on this blog is mostly cross-posted on my [dev.to](https://dev.to/amuuu) and [Medium](https://amuuu.medium.com). There are also somethings that I write/have wrote in repositories. Here's a list of them:


- [OS Notes](https://github.com/amuuu/os-notes): Notes about operating systems collected from all over the internet and my brain. 
- [Problems and Solutions](https://github.com/funktional-stdo/problems-and-solutions): A list of problems/bugs I faced when doing projects + the solutions that I came up with, so hopefully you don't need to spend 10/20 hours like I did.
